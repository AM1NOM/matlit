  "explanation": "When the graph is reflected in the line $y = 1$, we obtain the following:\n\nWe can find the equation of the reflected curve in a variety of ways. One is to observe that the reflection is centred about $y = 2$, as the values go from $y = 1$ to $y = 3$. The cosine curve is 'upside-down', so the equation must be $y = -(\\cos x) + 2 = 2 - \\cos x$.\n\nAnother way to see this is as follows. The reflection of $y = f(x)$ in the $x$-axis ($y = 0$) is $y = -f(x)$. When the line of reflection is translated, the whole reflection is translated. Since $y = 0$ is transformed to $y = 2$, the reflection of the function must be translated to give $y = 2 - f(x)$.\n\nThe result is then translated by $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ in the positive $x$-direction, so that $x$ is replaced by $x - \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.

  "answer": 4,
  "explanation": "We begin by simplifying this expression; we write each term as a product of prime powers to obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{10^{c-2d} \\times 20^{2c+d}}{8^c \\times 125^{c+d}} = \\frac{(2 \\times 5)^{c-2d} \\times (2^2 \\times 5)^{2c+d}}{(2^3)^c \\times (5^3)^{c+d}} \\\\ = \\frac{2^{c-2d+2(2c+d)} \\times 5^{c-2d+(2c+d)}}{2^{3c} \\times 5^{3(c+d)}} \\\\ = \\frac{2^{5c} \\times 5^{3c-d}}{2^{3c} \\times 5^{3c+3d}} \\\\ = 2^{2c} \\times 5^{-4d}$$\n\nFor this to be an integer, we require $2c$ and $-4d$ to be non-negative integers. Since $c$ and $d$ are non-zero integers, we need $c > 0$ and $d < 0$, which is option E.\n\n(In fact, this is an “if and only if” condition; options C, D and F would make the expression non-integer, as would A and G; while conditions B and H are necessary, they are not sufficient: if $d < 0$, it is still possible that $c < 0$, so it is not true that the given expression is (necessarily) an integer if $d < 0$.)",

  "explanation": "We first consider each of the inequalities separately.\n\nA sketch of the graph of $y = \\tan x$ for $0 \\le x \\le \\pi$ is as follows:\n\nNoting that $\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 1$ and $\\tan \\frac{3\\pi}{4} = -1$, we see from the sketch that $-1 \\le \\tan x \\le 1$ when $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and when $\\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\le x \\le \\pi$.\n\nNext, we sketch the graph of $y = \\sin 2x$ over the same interval:\n\nNoting that $\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\sin \\frac{5\\pi}{6} = 0.5$, we see from the sketch that $\\sin 2x \\ge 0.5$ when $\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\le 2x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, that is, when $\\frac{\\pi}{12} \\le x \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$.\n\nNow comparing the intervals for the tangent and sine inequalities, we note that they are both satisfied when $\\frac{\\pi}{12} \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, and the length of this interval is $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$, so the answer is B.",

  "answer": 3,
  "explanation": "The first four terms are 4, 4r, 4r² and 4r³. We are also given that 4, 4r and 4r³ are three successive terms of an arithmetic series. We thus have\n\n$$4r = 4 + d$$\n\n$$4r^3 = 4 + 2d$$\n\nwhere d is the common difference of this arithmetic series.\n\nTherefore d = 4(r - 1) from the first equation, and d = 4r(r² - 1) on subtracting the two equations.\n\nEquating these expressions for d gives\n\n$$4(r - 1) = 4r(r^2 - 1)$$\n\nso r - 1 = r(r - 1)(r + 1) on factorising and dividing by 4.\n\nSince 0 < r < 1, we can divide by r - 1 to obtain 1 = r(r + 1), so r² + r - 1 = 0. The solutions to this quadratic are\n\n$$r = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$$\n\nSince r > 0, we have r = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}, and so the sum to infinity (given by the standard formula S_\\infty = \\frac{4}{1-r}) is\n\n$$\\frac{4}{1 - \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}} = \\frac{8}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{8(3 + \\sqrt{5})}{9 - 5} = 2(3 + \\sqrt{5})$$\n\nand the answer is D.",
